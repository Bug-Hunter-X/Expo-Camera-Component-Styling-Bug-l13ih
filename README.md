# Expo Camera Component Styling Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug related to styling the Expo Camera component.  The preview may not render correctly with custom styling, resulting in unexpected layout behavior.

## Bug Description

When applying custom styles (e.g., flexbox or absolute positioning) to the Camera component, the preview area might not render as expected. It could be misaligned, have incorrect dimensions, or display unexpected padding/margins. This issue is particularly noticeable on different screen sizes and aspect ratios.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the Camera preview layout.  It will likely be improperly rendered.  The `cameraBug.js` file shows the problematic styling.

## Solution

The `cameraBugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution by carefully adjusting the styling to accommodate the Camera component's inherent layout characteristics.  The key is often to avoid certain styles that interfere with the camera's internal rendering.  Consider using `flex` to control the overall layout rather than absolute positioning unless necessary.
